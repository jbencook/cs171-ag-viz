Agri-gation Dashboard
=============

Welcome to our CS171 final project, a Century of Corn. Our main website is: http://jbencook.github.io/cs171-ag-viz/

We visualize how US corn yield has changed in the 20th century, along with indicators which may effect yield. To display the interactive visualizations locally, after putting the files on your computer navigate to the project root directory and run: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
