A Century of Corn
=============

Welcome to our CS171 final project, a <b>Century of Corn</b>. Our main website is: http://jbencook.github.io/cs171-ag-viz/

We visualize how US corn yield has changed in the 20th century, along with indicators which affect yield, such as precipitation and temperature (and, locally, soil type). To display the interactive visualizations locally with respect to your *computer*, after putting the files on your computer navigate to the project root directory and run: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
