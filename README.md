Ag Dashboard
=============

This is the CS171 project. The idea is to visualize how data that affects a farm changes over space and time. These variables have complex relationships with one another and we use d3 to represent these relationships

To display the interactive visualizations locally, run: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
