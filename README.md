Agri-gation Dashboard
=============

Welcome to our CS171 final project. We are visualizing how data that affects a farm, changes over space and time. These variables have complex relationships with one another, that we represent using d3.

To display the interactive visualizations locally, run: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`


### TODO:

1. Create county yield choropleth
2. Create 2-D brush to select counties
3. Create time brush to select years
4. Set up d3.js template for field-level yield
5. Set up d3.js template for histogram
6. Set up d3.js for time series climate data
7. ???
8. Profit!
