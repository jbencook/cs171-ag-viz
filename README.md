Agri-gation Dashboard
=============

Welcome to our CS171 final project. We are visualizing how data that affects a farm, changes over space and time. These variables have complex relationships with one another, that we represent using d3.

To display the interactive visualizations locally, navigate to the project root directory and run: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
